Quick Update
------
> We've been quite behind on our app these last few weeks but have managed to 
> make some headway. We finally have an MVP up and running on a heroku server, 
> have talked to some potential consumers about their ideas, and have strict goals
> for what to accomplish next time. We will outline these progressions now.

MVP
------
> The link to our MVP can be found here: https://morning-ridge-61478.herokuapp.com. 
> Right now all we have is a homepage, which took annoyingly long considering it's 
> simplicity. Neither of us have much experience with html or css, so learning the ropes
> took a little bit of practice. In the end we are satisfied with our result. We aimed to achieve
> a simple, yet engaging homepage. Something that, similar to the Conversion Centered Design we read
> about, would not overwhelm the customer but would still guide them in the right direction. The result
> is a homepage with a clear, pronounced header ("Find the Best Local Deals") with two actions
> that you can take: promote or search. Simple as that. The buttons currently don't lead to 
> any other pages but we will outline what we wish for them to accomplish in our 'Goals' section.

Interviews
------
> We talked to some of our friends on their thoughts regarding Promotr as a whole as well
> as the webpage.
>
> *Homepage*: We originally just had one button, the search function. But after some concerns 
> from interviewees about how people/companies would promote things, we realized that a promote 
> button should be expressed clearly on the homepage. This gives our app a dual role: it's main 
> service is to enable users to see local deals but these local companies/events must also have a way
> of posting to our app. Having only two buttons on the homepage simplifies things, and, we hope, will 
> lead to more 'conversions'.
>
> *Promotr*: All the people we interviewed regarding Promotr had positive thoughts regarding
> the idea. None had apps that told them if discounts or happy hours were occuring in the area. 
> We asked each what factor has the biggest influence when shopping (either for products or food) 
> and all either said proximity or pricing. So we think that this app truly could be revolutionary 
> in the way that it helps people take advantage of those two things: finding this close to you while
> also finding things that are affordable. 

Goals
------
> The main goals right now are to give actual pages for the promote and search button.
>
> *promote*: this button will take the user to a page where they can sign up for our service
> and submit postings (at a cost). Initially, we won't charge for services since we wish to build
> up a customer base and test things out. Companies/restaurants will obviously be inclined to participate
> in this because it is free advertisement. A user who wishes to post a promotion will be promted to enter
> several things: the location of the promotion, a small (less than 100 words) description of the promotion,
> pictures if necessary, and a tag indicating the category of the promotion (clothing, food, etc.). A simple
> api will be designed to facilitate this process and allow customers to create an account that is automatically
> billed for each promotion posted. We are still trying to flush out the details on how long the promotion will 
> be displayed, as well as getting analytics for how many people view the promotions, which we can use
> as statistics to convince users that promotions actually work.
>
> *search*: this button will take the user to a page that displays all the nearby promotions. The default is a 5 mile
> radius but the user can select how close or how far away they wish to search, as well as enter a specific category
> of promotions they wish to search in (clothing, food, etc.). The promotions will be displayed in a list
> style, colorfully promoted and with small descriptions for each. Ideally the user will be able to click 
> the ad and use the google maps api to get directions there.
>

The Works
------
> So how will this all work exactly? The basic idea is that promoters will submit promotions to our api,
> which will get entered in a database, keyed on location. Then, when a user searches for nearby promotions,
> our app will gather all relevant locations in the specified radius and query those locations in our database,
> pulling out the information for each location if it exists. We will work on integrating the google maps api to 
> javascript, as well as establishing a MySQL databse to store all this information.
