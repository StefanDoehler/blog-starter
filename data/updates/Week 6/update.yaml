> For this week we worked on more interviews. We talked with 5 local performers what their need are and if they would use the product with its current design. They were all interested, but they pointed out that the product will work best if venues are invested as well. Otherwise, the responsibility of filling seats falls entirely on the performer instead of the split responsibility they have today. With that in mind we have begun reaching out to venues, but have not had must luck with recruitment. When/if we hear back from them, I expect the language of pitch to shift slightly although the substance of the product should remain the same.

> As for the consumer facing side, many have expressed skepticism about the event promotion aspect of Promotr, but are interested in the the coupon aggregation. However, it does not seem like a good idea to abandon the event promotion, because it seems that the need for better means of promoting an event is much greater for performers than the need for cheap food by others. So it seems like an incrementally better solution to broadcasting where performers are playing has the potential to uniquely address a problem in a community whereas the coupon aggregation is a competitive field. (If iTunes and Spotify disrupted the way people consume recorded music, then a goal would be to figure a mechanism by which Promotr could disrupt the way people consume live music.)

> We will also be speaking with local business owners this week about the coupon aggregation side of the product. We will be asking specifically if we can post deals related to their business on our board. We will also be reaching out to the performers we interviewed to check when their next show is. All of this will be posted on a static site that should be up by Thursday. (The next steo will be to add the ability for users to post.) Our stack is a URL pointed to a Heroku app running Node with a Posgres database. (I think everyone in class is using this stack plus/minus Twilio integration.)
