Pivoting
------
We found our original idea, *sqrl*, to have too many problems, such as being able
to market such an app and to what specific demographic we could provide such a service. 
*Promotr* attempts to fortify some of these weaknesses.

The Consumer
------
> *Promotr* allows locals to easily discover what's going on in their area,
  from social events to promotional deals to restaurant happy hours.
>
> You and some friends are looking for a place to eat on a Friday night. You can pick from a handful
> favorites. Maybe Chipotle, maybe some good ol' Pita Ziki. But you want to change things up. In 
> particular you want to find something cheap. That's when you hop right on *Promotr*, giving you quick
> and easy access to a list of nearby restaurant deals, happy hours, and specials.
>
> You want to buy some clothes but are unsure where to shop. JCrew is just too damn expensive
> and Urban Outfitter is a little too tacky for your style. Sales are going on all the time but
> but how do you keep track of them? Simple. Open up *Promotr* and conveniently
> browse from a selection of nearby clothing store sales. Buy 1 get 1 free at Pacsun? Heading right over.
> 
> You have a friend from the west coast visiting. You've been telling him how awesome Yale is but for 
> some reason nothing seems to be happening on this Thursday night. No society, no High Street, not even
> Box. You quickly hop on *Promotr* to see if any other locals have posted about social events going on 
> right now. Magic the Gathering Tournament? Yeah probably not. Barracuda is popping? On our way.
>
> As a restaurant owner, you're convinced your little family owned pizzeria is going to be a huge 
> hit with the locals. The only problem? Getting the word out. You hear of this service called *Promotr*
> and sign up, allowing you to use their api to display ad content such as the time of your happy hour, 
> and whatever daily pie deals you may be having. 

$$$$$
------
> *Promotr* makes money by charging a fee for ad space. Companies pay a fee per ad to be
> displayed on the service. 

Getting Things Going
------
> We have two major demographics for *Promotr*: regular users and companies. Two important 
> and easily marketable groups for regular users are college campuses and big cities. We of course
> would start with New Haven, asking restaurants and clothing stores if they would interested in such a service, 
> and then we could ask Yalies if they would utilize such an app. Because we pivoted our idea recently,
> we have not had time to perform these interviews but plan on doing so over the next few weeks. Getting 
> a preliminary list of companies that would be on board would give both us, the developers, and potential
> users a good idea of what will be seen on the app.

Main Hurdles
------
> There are a number of possible concerns relating to the release of our app:
  * The app doesn't gain traction (so ad creators don't have a user base to market to)
  * Companies aren't interested in paying for such a service
  * This doesn't solve a problem or 'pain' that users share

As A User
------
> A large appeal of our web app would be the concept of anonymity. Users would not have to go through the hassle 
> of creating an account to browse, vote, or create posts. This allows greater freedom and availability.
>
> As a normal user I can open the app and browse through multiple pages. One page is labeled
> social events and another is labeled promotions. Each user is anonymous, so I don't have to create
> an account to post a social event. I can upvote or downvote social events, providing credibility. I can
> also view the ammount of people using *Promotr* that are in attendance of such an event.
> For promotions I can query results based on price and area, such as restaurant deals or clothes
> sales. The standard geopgraphical radius is 5 miles, but I can change this scope to be more specific or broad.
>
> As a company that wants to promote some sort of event or deal, you can sign up to use the service,
> which grants access to ad creation gui. This is where a company can design the information and aesthetic
> of the ad that will be displayed the users on *Promotr*. 

Technology
------
> We are still fleshing out the technological aspects of our web app but we would like to use
> JavaScript on both the server and client side with express for the web framework. Python is 
> also a possibility, with the use of Django. The database will likely be PostgreSQL or MySQL.
>
> The beginning stages of the app might involve a static site for New Haven. Once we can gage
> if there is a large enough user base, we can expand to offer an API and web GUI. Thus we only need 
> a shared hosting server at first.
>
> The client side involves pinging all the users within a certain geopgraphical radius and loading
> such information onto the user interface in the form of a list of ads and/or user posts. 
>
> The server side deals with the main chunk of the work. It stores ad information for each
> company that signs up for the service, as well as social events posted by anonymous users.
