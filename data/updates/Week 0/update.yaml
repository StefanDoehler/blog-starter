The Customer
------
> Sqrl is the airbnb of storage: a community of homeowners and storage seekers
> conveniently brought together through one simple app. 
>
> *Homeowners*, especially recent grads or middle-aged parents, often have rooms
> in their house that go unused. What better way to make some extra monthly income
> than to turn that room into a storage space. 
>
> *Renters*, especially college students, often need storage for small to medium sized
> items for weeks to months at a time. The process for finding such a space can often be
> stressful and expensive (as college students ourselves we have witnessed this process 
> first hand). Sqrl gets rid of all those unnecessary hassles, providing a market that 
> allows a quick and easy way to connect to nearby homeowners.
