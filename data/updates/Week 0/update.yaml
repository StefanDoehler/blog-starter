The Customer
------
> Sqrl is the airbnb of storage: a community of homeowners and storage seekers
> conveniently brought together through one simple app. 
>
> *Homeowners*, especially recent grads or middle-aged parents, often have rooms
> in their house that go unused. What better way to make some extra monthly income
> than to turn that room into a storage space. 
>
> *Renters*, especially college students, often need storage for small to medium sized
> items for weeks to months at a time. The process for finding such a space can often be
> stressful and expensive (as college students ourselves we have witnessed this process 
> first hand). Sqrl gets rid of all those unnecessary hassles, providing a market that 
> allows a quick and easy way to connect to nearby homeowners. 
>
> Sqrl's method of generating revenue relies upon charging a cut of each transaction that 
> occurs on the app. This could be a low percentage, such that it doesn't deter possible 
> consumers while also keeping costs low for renters.

Getting Things Going
------
> Our main consumer demographic for sqrl is the average college student so sending out 
> fliers and posting on social media seems like a good first start. College students
> often rent out their own apartments, and serve the dual role of being either a homeowner
> or storage renter. 
>
> Yale staff members are also potential consumers so relaying information to them is crucial
> in the early stages of our app growth. Ideally, any homeowner, whether temporarily or permanently,
> would wish to use this app, so marketing in popular New Haven restaurants and other public venues
> is a good way to spread the word.

Hurdles
------
> There are a number of possible concerns relating to the release of our app:
  * Renters are not comfortable storing items in a stranger's house
  * Homeowners steal items from renters
  * The renter or homeowner pool is too small
  * People attempt to undercut the system and make a transaction directly (without sqrl)
  * Consumers find more convenient methods of storage

Solutions and Impact
------
> While the problems listed above are certainly plausible, our plan of action for sqrl 
> should mediate them. For example, we could interview possible consumers, mainly college
> students, to see how comfortable they are with the sharing economy. Additionally, in
> order to provide more security and reassurance for renters, one of the main features of 
> sqrl would be a ratings system. After each transaction, homeowners and renters can be rated
> by one another based upon treatment of storage items (were they returned in the same condition)
> and ease of transaction. Consumers could also file claims if items are lost during a transaction.
>
> Considering all these problems are avoided, sqrl would become an impact that has a substantial impact
> on the lives of its consumers. Convenience and affordability are the two main selling points of
> sqrl. Allowing a renter to easily and quickly find a storage space with a few button clicks would
> lower stress and allow a college student to focus on other matters. Similarly, sqrl provides a painless
> source of extra income at practically no extra work for homeowners.

As A User
------
> As a user seeking a storage space I can login. A map interface is revealed, allowing me to input
> my current address. Sqrl then locates all the nearby homeowners who are willing to rent out space,
> providing a list view filled with a homeowner's average rating, storage space size, price, and date of 
> availability. If I like a homeowner's specs, I can send that person a message and we can arrange a 
> pickup date. After the transaction, I can rate the homeowner. 
>
> From the homeowner's side, the process is much simpler. I create a homeowner account, filling in 
> my address, storage space size and daily/weekly/monthly rate. Sqrl will then ping me once a renter
> has made an offer, and I can communicate with that renter through the app.

Technology
------
> We are still fleshing out the technological aspects of our web app but we would like to use
> JavaScript on both the server and client side with express for the web framework. Python is 
> also a possibility, with the use of Django. The database will likely be PostgreSQL or MySQL.
>
> The client side allows browsing through nearby homeowner locations, which means it has to 
> generate a map, populated with users from the server. Doing this quickly will certainly pose
> a challenge and we will have to look into existing frameworks.
>
> The server side deals with the main chunk of the work. It stores information about each consumer,
> including reviews and message history.
